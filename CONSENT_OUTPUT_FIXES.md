# Consent Output Fixes - Summary

## Problem Statement

Two issues were identified in the consent_converter.py output:

1. **Missing {{today_date}} placeholder**: When "Date: ___" appeared in the header (not "Date of Birth" or "Date Signed"), it was not being replaced with a placeholder. The underscores were left in the output.

2. **Unwanted signature lines at the bottom**: Various signature-related lines that should not be in patient-facing consents were appearing at the bottom of the output, including:
   - Witness signature lines (e.g., "Witness's Signature Date")
   - Doctor signature lines (e.g., "Doctor's Signature Date")
   - Parent/Guardian signature lines (e.g., "Patient/Parent/Guardian Signature Date")
   - Lines with only underscores ("____________________________________________")

## Solution

### 1. Added {{today_date}} Placeholder

**Location**: `consent_converter.py`, lines 693-697

Added new pattern matching to replace standalone "Date: ___" with "Date: {{today_date}}":

```python
# Replace standalone Date placeholders (not Date of Birth or Date Signed)
# Pattern: "Date: ___" with underscores first (most specific)
content = re.sub(r'(?<!of\s)(?<!Birth\s)(?<!Signed\s)Date\s*:\s*_+', 'Date: {{today_date}}', content, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
# Pattern: "Date:" without underscores (avoid replacing already replaced text and Date of Birth/Date Signed)
content = re.sub(r'(?<!of\s)(?<!Birth\s)(?<!Signed\s)Date\s*:(?!\s*\{\{)', 'Date: {{today_date}}', content, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

**Key features**:
- Uses negative lookbehind (`(?<!...)`) to avoid matching "Date of Birth:" or "Date Signed:"
- Case-insensitive matching
- Prevents double replacement using negative lookahead
- Works with any number of underscores

### 2. Enhanced Signature Line Filtering

**Location**: `consent_converter.py`, lines 517-579

Enhanced the `_is_witness_or_doctor_signature_field()` method to filter additional patterns:

#### New Patterns Added:

**Witness indicators** (with apostrophe variations):
```python
witness_indicators = [
    'witness signature', 'witness printed name', 'witness name', 'witness date',
    'witnessed by', 'witness:', 'witness relationship', "witness's", 'witness's'
]
```

**Doctor indicators** (with apostrophe variations):
```python
doctor_signatures = [
    'doctor signature', 'dentist signature', 'physician signature',
    'dr. signature', 'practitioner signature', 'provider signature', 
    'clinician signature', "doctor's", 'doctor's'
]
```

**Parent/Guardian indicators** (new):
```python
parent_guardian_signatures = [
    'parent signature', 'guardian signature', 'parent's signature', 
    "parent's signature", 'guardian's signature', "guardian's signature",
    'legal guardian's', "legal guardian's"
]
```

**Additional filters**:
- Lines containing "patient/parent/guardian" (e.g., "Patient/Parent/Guardian Signature Date")
- Lines with mostly underscores (70%+ underscores in lines with 10+ characters)
- Printed name fields in parent/guardian/witness context

## Testing

### Unit Tests Created

1. **test_today_date_placeholder.py** - Tests the new {{today_date}} placeholder
   - Verifies "Date: ___" is replaced with {{today_date}}
   - Verifies "Date of Birth:" still uses {{patient_dob}}
   - Verifies "Date Signed:" is not affected
   - Tests documents with multiple date patterns

2. **test_enhanced_signature_filtering.py** - Tests the enhanced filtering
   - Tests witness lines with apostrophes (both ' and ')
   - Tests doctor lines with apostrophes
   - Tests parent/guardian signature lines
   - Tests underscore-only line filtering
   - Tests complex documents with multiple patterns

### Test Results

All tests pass:
```
✓ test_consent_placeholders.py - All existing tests pass
✓ test_today_date_placeholder.py - All new tests pass
✓ test_enhanced_signature_filtering.py - All new tests pass
✓ test_refactoring.py - No regressions
```

### Real Document Validation

Tested with actual consent documents:
- ✓ TN OS Consent Form.docx
- ✓ Endo Consent .docx
- ✓ Informed Consent Crown & Bridge Prosthetic.docx
- ✓ EndoConsentFINAL122024.docx
- ✓ ExtractionConsentFINAL122024.docx

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: TN OS Consent Form

**Before:**
```html
Date: _____________
Patient Name: {{patient_name}} Date of Birth: {{patient_dob}}
...
I give consent to surgery.
_________________________________________ ________________________________
Patient's (Legal Guardian's) Signature Date Doctor's Signature Date
_________________________________________
Witness's Signature Date
```

**After:**
```html
Date: {{today_date}}
Patient Name: {{patient_name}} Date of Birth: {{patient_dob}}
...
I give consent to surgery.
```

### Example 2: Endo Consent

**Before:**
```html
Tooth Number: ______ Diagnosis: {{diagnosis}}
...
Occasionally, a tooth which has had root canal treatment may require retreatment, surgery, or even extraction.
____________________________________________ _______________________
Patient/Parent/Guardian Signature Date
____________________________________________ ________________________
Patient/Parent/Guardian Name (Print) Witness
____________________________________________
```

**After:**
```html
Tooth Number: ______ Diagnosis: {{diagnosis}}
...
Occasionally, a tooth which has had root canal treatment may require retreatment, surgery, or even extraction.
```

- ✅ No unwanted witness, doctor, or parent/guardian signature lines in output
- ✅ Cleaner, more professional consent forms
- ✅ All patient-facing fields preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ All tests pass with no regressions
