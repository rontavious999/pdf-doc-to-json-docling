# Section Title Fix - Consent Forms

## Issue
The section for consent forms (e.g., screenshot5.png - Olympia Hills Family Dental Warranty Document) was showing as the generic "Form" instead of using the actual document title.

## Root Cause
The title detection logic in `_create_enhanced_consent_html()` only recognized specific patterns:
1. Lines starting with `## ` (markdown headers)
2. All-caps lines containing "CONSENT"  
3. Lines starting with "Informed Consent for"

However, it didn't recognize **bold markdown titles** like `**Olympia Hills Family Dental Warranty Document**`, which are commonly used in DOCX documents converted by Docling.

## Solution
Added a new pattern to detect bold markdown titles (`**title**`) with a length check to avoid treating long paragraphs as titles.

### Code Change
In `consent_converter.py`, added to the `_create_enhanced_consent_html()` method:

```python
elif content_lines and re.match(r'^\*\*(.+)\*\*$', content_lines[0]):
    # Match bold markdown titles like "**Olympia Hills Family Dental Warranty Document**"
    match = re.match(r'^\*\*(.+)\*\*$', content_lines[0])
    if match and len(match.group(1)) < 150:  # Reasonable title length
        title = match.group(1).strip()
        content_lines = content_lines[1:]  # Remove title from content
```

## Results

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "key": "form_1",
  "title": "",
  "section": "Form",  // Generic section name
  ...
}
```

### After Fix
```json
{
  "key": "form_1",
  "title": "",
  "section": "Olympia Hills Family Dental Warranty Document",  // Actual document title
  ...
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Verified with multiple consent documents:
- ✅ **Olympia Hills Family Dental Warranty Document** - Section correctly set to document title
- ✅ **Informed Consent for Tooth Extraction** - Existing pattern still works
- ✅ **INFORMATIONAL INFORMED CONSENT COMPLETE DENTURES AND PARTIAL DENTURES** - All-caps pattern still works

### Automated Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass (test_consent_placeholders.py, test_today_date_placeholder.py, test_integration_placeholders.py, test_enhanced_signature_filtering.py)
- ✅ New comprehensive test created and passes (test_bold_title_detection.py)
  - Tests bold markdown titles
  - Tests length filtering (long paragraphs not treated as titles)
  - Tests all existing patterns still work
  - 6/6 tests pass

## Impact

### Positive Impact
- **Improved User Experience**: Users now see meaningful section names (e.g., "Olympia Hills Family Dental Warranty Document") instead of generic "Form"
- **Better Organization**: Consent forms are easier to identify and organize
- **Consistent with Expectations**: Section names match the actual form titles

### No Breaking Changes
- **Minimal Code Change**: Only 5 lines added
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing title patterns continue to work
- **No Regressions**: All existing tests pass

## Files Modified
1. **consent_converter.py** - Added bold markdown title detection (5 lines)
2. **test_bold_title_detection.py** - New comprehensive test file (138 lines)
3. **CONSENT_CONVERTER_README.md** - Updated documentation to reflect new behavior
