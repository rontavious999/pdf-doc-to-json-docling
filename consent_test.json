Even when care and diligence is exercised in the treatment of conditions requiring crowns and bridgework and fabrication of the same, there are no promises or guarantees of anticipated results or the length of time the crown and/or fixed bridgework will last. I agree to assume the risks associated with crowns and/or fixed bridgework, which include but are not limited to the following: ## 1. Reduction of tooth structure To replace decayed or otherwise traumatized teeth, it is necessary to modify the existing tooth or teeth so that crowns (caps) and/or bridges may be placed upon them. Tooth preparation will be done as conservatively as practical, but I understand that normally at least some of my existing tooth structure will be removed. ## 2. Numbness following use of anesthesia In preparation of teeth for crowns or bridges, anesthetics are usually needed. As a result of the injection or use of anesthesia, at times there may be swelling, jaw muscle tenderness or even a resultant numbness of the tongue, lips, teeth, jaws and/or facial tissues that is usually temporary; in rare instances, such numbness may be permanent.</p>",
