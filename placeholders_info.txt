Here’s a plain-English explainer you can hand to anyone on the team about when to use Modento placeholders in forms and consents.

What placeholders are (and why they exist)
Placeholders are little variables (like {{patient_name}} or {{practice_name}}) that Modento replaces automatically with real data it already knows—from your Practice Management System (PMS) or the Practice Info in Engagement. They save patients from re-typing basics and make documents feel personalized and accurate.

Where they belong
Use placeholders only in static text—things the patient reads but doesn’t type into—such as:
	•	intro paragraphs
	•	Consent narratives and hints/help text beneath questions
	•	Static lines that reference the practice or appointment details
Do not use placeholders in controls that the patient must actively complete:
	•	Not in signature or initials controls
	•	Not as a replacement for required inputs (e.g., don’t skip a DOB input you actually need the patient to confirm today)

When you should use them
1) Patient identity that’s already known
Use: {{patient_name}}, {{patient_first_name}}, {{patient_preferred_name}}, {{patient_dob}}, {{patient_email}}, {{patient_phone}}, {{patient_address}}
	•	Why: Reduces friction—patients shouldn’t re-enter obvious info if it’s already in your PMS.
	•	Where: Read-only confirmations in consent text, and hints (e.g., “If anything below is incorrect, please update it in the fields provided.”).
	•	Tip: If you must collect updates, still keep the input fields; the placeholder is just for the read-only narrative.
Example
“I, {{patient_name}}, born {{patient_dob}}, consent to the procedure described below.”

2) Appointment context
Use: {{patient_appointment_date}}, {{patient_appointment_time}}, {{patient_appointment_date_time}}, {{patient_next_provider}}
	•	Why: Keeps consents and pre-visit forms aligned to the actual visit.
	•	Where: Consent intros (“… for my appointment on {{patient_appointment_date_time}} with {{patient_next_provider}}.”)

4) Practice identity
Use: {{practice_name}}, {{practice_address}}, {{practice_phone}}, {{practice_email}}, {{practice_doctor}}, {{practice_all_doctors}}
	•	Why: Legal clarity and professionalism; keeps your forms/consents accurate if practice details change.
	•	Where: “Questions? Contact…” sections, and the body of consents referencing the provider or location.

5) Today’s date
Use: {{today_date}}
	•	Why: Handy for stamped text (e.g., “This consent was presented on {{today_date}}.”).
	•	Note: This is separate from the signature date field the patient completes; keep the signature date as an actual date control to capture their action time.

When you should not use them
	•	Do not replace patient actions. Placeholders can pre-fill text, but they don’t prove consent. Keep acknowledgment checkbox, signature, and date as live fields.
	•	Avoid placeholders in questions/options where the value needs to be stored exactly as answered (it can get messy in exports).
	•	Don’t rely on placeholders for data you must verify today. If a field must be confirmed/updated (e.g., current medications, new phone number), use a real input.

Handling missing data (real-world behavior)
Sometimes the PMS doesn’t have a value. Design your wording so a blank won’t read awkwardly. For example:
	•	Good: “I, {{patient_name}}, authorize…” → If name is missing, your intake still continues; the name input below captures it.

Practical dos & don’ts
Do
	•	Use placeholders to personalize static text and reduce re-typing.
	•	Pair placeholders with real inputs where confirmation is legally or operationally required.
	•	Use practice/appointment placeholders to keep documents context-accurate.
	•	Keep signature and acknowledgment as actual controls (never placeholders).

Don’t
	•	Don’t put placeholders inside the signature/initials fields.
	•	Don’t remove an input you truly need just because you can echo a placeholder in the narrative.
	•	Don’t assume every record has every field—write copy that’s robust to blanks.
	•	Do not add placeholders unless the text prompts for that information.

Quick examples

Consent opening
