I agree to assume the risks associated with<br>crowns and/or fixed bridgework, which include but are not limited to the following:<br>1. Reduction of tooth structure<br>To replace decayed or otherwise traumatized teeth, it is necessary to modify the existing tooth or<br>teeth so that crowns (caps) and/or bridges may be placed upon them. Tooth preparation will be done<br>as conservatively as practical, but I understand that normally at least some of my existing tooth<br>structure will be removed.<br>2. Numbness following use of anesthesia<br>In preparation of teeth for crowns or bridges, anesthetics are usually needed. As a result of the<br>injection or use of anesthesia, at times there may be swelling, jaw muscle tenderness or even a<br>resultant numbness of the tongue, lips, teeth, jaws and/or facial tissues that is usually temporary; in<br>rare instances, such numbness may be permanent.<br>3. Sensitivity of teeth<br>Often, after the preparation of teeth for the reception of either crowns or bridges, the teeth may exhibit<br>mild to severe sensitivity. This sensitivity may last only for a short period of time or for a much longer<br>period. If it is persistent, notify us so that we can determine the cause of the sensitivity and seek to<br>treat that condition.<br>4. Crown or bridge abutment teeth may require root canal treatment<br>After being crowned, teeth may develop a condition known as pulpitis or pulpal degeneration. The<br>tooth or teeth may have been traumatized from an accident, deep decay, extensive preparation for the<br>crown or bridge, or from other causes. It may be necessary to do root canal treatments on the affected<br>teeth. If teeth remain sensitive for long periods of time following crowning, root canal treatment may<br>be necessary. Infrequently, the tooth or teeth may abscess or otherwise not heal, which may require<br>root canal treatment, root surgery or possibly extraction.<br>5. Breakage<br>Crowns and bridges may chip or break. Many factors can contribute to this situation, including<br>chewing excessively hard materials, change in biting forces, traumatic blows to the mouth, etc.<br>Undetectable cracks may develop in crowns from these causes, but the crowns/bridges themselves<br>may not actually break until sometime later. Breakage or chipping because of defective materials or<br>construction is somewhat uncommon. If it does occur, it usually occurs soon after placement.<br>6. Uncomfortable or strange feeling<br>Crowns and bridges are artificial and therefore feel different from natural teeth. Most patients<br>become accustomed to this feeling over time. In limited situations, muscle soreness or tenderness of<br>the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) — jaw joint — may persist for indeterminable periods of time,<br>following placement of the prosthesis.<br>7. Aesthetics or appearance<br>Patients will be given the opportunity to observe the appearance of crowns or bridges in place, prior<br>to final cementation. While satisfactory, this fact is usually acknowledged by an entry into the patient's<br>chart, initialed by the patient.<br>8. Longevity of crowns and bridges<br>Many variables determine how long crowns and bridges can be expected to last. Among these are some<br>of the factors mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, including the general health of the patient, oral<br>hygiene, regular dental checkups and diet. As a result, no guarantees can be made or assumed to be<br>made regarding the longevity of the crowns or bridges.<br>It is a patient's responsibility to seek attention from the dentist should any undue or unexpected problems<br>occur. The patient must diligently follow any and all instruction, including the scheduling of and<br>attendance at all appointments. Failure to keep the cementation appointment can result in ultimate failure<br>of the crown/bridge to fit properly, and an additional fee may be assessed.<br><strong>Informed Consent</strong><br>I have been given the opportunity to ask any questions regarding the nature and purpose of crowns and/<br>or bridge treatment, and have received answers to my satisfaction. I voluntarily accept any and all risks,<br>including those listed above and including the risk of substantial harm, if any, which may be associated<br>with any phase of this treatment, in hopes of obtaining the desired results, which may or may not be<br>achieved. By signing this document, I am freely giving my consent to allow and authorize<br>Dr. {{provider}} and/or his/her associates to<br>render any treatment necessary and/or advisable to my dental conditions, including the prescribing and<br>administering of any medications and/or anesthetics deemed necessary to my treatment.<br>Tooth No(s). {{tooth_or_site}}</div>"
