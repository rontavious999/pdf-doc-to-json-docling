# Consent Form Fixes - Summary

## Problem Statement
For consent_converter.py, the following issues were reported based on screenshots 6, 7, and 8:
1. Section name should be the title of the form (e.g., "Labial Frenectomy Informed Consent")
2. Patient's Name: should have {{patient_name}} placeholder
3. Parent/Guardian's Name should be a separate question field (Modento compliant)

---

## Issue 1: Section Name Not Using Form Title

### Before
```json
{
  "key": "form_1",
  "title": "",
  "section": "Form",  // ❌ Generic section name
  ...
}
```

### After
```json
{
  "key": "form_1",
  "title": "",
  "section": "Labial Frenectomy Informed Consent",  // ✅ Actual form title
  ...
}
```

### Fix Applied
Added title pattern detection for titles ending with "Informed Consent":
```python
elif content_lines and re.match(r'^.+\s+Informed\s+Consent\s*$', content_lines[0], re.IGNORECASE):
    # Match titles like "Labial Frenectomy Informed Consent"
    if len(content_lines[0].strip()) < 150:  # Reasonable title length
        title = content_lines[0].strip()
        content_lines = content_lines[1:]
```

## Issue 2: Patient's Name Missing Placeholder

### Before
```html
Patient's Name: Patient Date of Birth:
```
❌ No placeholder - just tabs/spaces

### After
```html
Patient's Name: {{patient_name}}Patient Date of Birth: {{patient_dob}}
```
✅ Proper placeholder for both Patient's Name and DOB

### Fix Applied
Added pattern matching for "Patient's Name:" with apostrophe:
```python
# Pattern: "Patient's Name:" (with apostrophe-s) - match with or without underscores/tabs
content = re.sub(r"Patient['\u2019]s\s+Name\s*:\s*[\s\t_]*", 'Patient\'s Name: {{patient_name}}', content, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

## Issue 3: Parent/Guardian's Name Not a Separate Field

### Before
```json
{
  "key": "form_1",
  "control": {
    "html_text": "...Parent/Guardian's Name: __________________________________..."
  }
}
```
❌ Appears as text in HTML content with underscores

### After
```json
{
  "key": "form_1",
  "control": {
    "html_text": "...I understand the above statements and have had my questions answered</div>"
  }
},
{
  "key": "parent_guardian_name",
  "title": "Parent/Guardian Name",
  "section": "Signature",
  "optional": false,
  "type": "input",
  "control": {
    "input_type": "name",
    "hint": null
  }
}
```
✅ Separate Modento-compliant input field with proper structure

### Fix Applied
1. Added field pattern to extract parent/guardian name:
```python
(r"Parent/Guardian['\u2019]s\s+Name\s*:", 'parent_guardian_name', 'Parent/Guardian Name', 'input', {'input_type': 'name', 'hint': None})
```

2. Modified signature section detection to recognize parent/guardian name:
```python
if (re.search(r'signature\s*:', line_lower) or 
    re.search(r'patient\s+signature', line_lower) or
    re.search(r'parent.*name\s*:', line_lower) or
    re.search(r'guardian.*name\s*:', line_lower)):
```

3. Updated filtering logic to distinguish Name (extract) from Signature (filter):
```python
def _is_witness_or_doctor_signature_field(self, line_lower: str, filter_parent_guardian_names: bool = True):
```

## Testing

### New Tests Created
Created `test_labial_frenectomy_fixes.py` with 6 comprehensive tests:
1. Title detection for "X Informed Consent" pattern
2. Patient's Name placeholder replacement
3. Parent/Guardian's Name field extraction
4. Parent/Guardian's Name filtered from HTML
5. Parent/Guardian's Signature still filtered
6. Complete workflow integration

### Test Results
```
======================== 24 passed, 20 warnings in 4.92s ========================
- 18 existing tests: PASSED ✅
- 6 new tests: PASSED ✅
- No regressions ✅
```

### Verified Documents
- ✅ Labial Frenectomy Informed Consent (primary test case)
- ✅ Informed Consent Crown & Bridge Prosthetic (no regression)
- ✅ Informed Consent Endodontic Procedure (no regression)

## Files Modified
1. **consent_converter.py** (5 sections modified, ~25 lines total)
   - Title detection (4 lines added)
   - Patient's Name placeholder (2 lines added)
   - Parent/Guardian Name field pattern (1 line added)
   - Signature section detection (4 lines modified)
   - Filtering logic (14 lines modified)

2. **test_labial_frenectomy_fixes.py** (NEW - 310 lines)

## Impact

### Positive Impact
✅ Section names now show meaningful form titles  
✅ Patient's Name properly replaced with {{patient_name}} placeholder  
✅ Parent/Guardian Name properly extracted as Modento-compliant field
