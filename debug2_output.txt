Section detected: Primary Dental Plan from line: If we are a contracted provider with your plan , you are responsible only for your portion of the approved fee as determined by your plan. We are required to collect the patient's portion (deductible, co -insurance, co-pay, or any amount not covered by the dental benefit plan) in full at time of service. If our estimate of your portion is less than the amount determined by your plan, the amount billed to you will be adjusted to reflect this.
Section detected: Primary Dental Plan from line: If we are not a contracted provider with your dental benefit plan , it is the patient's responsibility to verify with the plan whether the plan allows patients to receive reimbursement for services from out-of-network providers. If your plan allows reimbursement for services from out-of-network providers, our practice can file the claim with your plan and receive reimbursement directly from the plan if you 'assign benefits' to us. In this circumstance, you are responsible and will be billed for any unpaid balance for services rendered upon receipt of payment from the plan to our practice, even if that amount is different than our estimated patient portion of the bill. If you choose to not 'assign benefits' to our practice, you are responsible for filing claims and obtaining reimbursement directly from your dental benefit plan and will be responsible for payment in full to our practice before or at the time of service.
