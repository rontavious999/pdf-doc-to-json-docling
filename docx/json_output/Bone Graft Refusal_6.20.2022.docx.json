Bone grafting is a method to reduce or offset this bone atrophy after extraction(s), or to supplement bone around an implant. It is now considered standard of care for routine extractions.<br>I have been informed of the doctor's recommendation of bone grafting for the preservation of my own periodontal bone and improved healing post-extraction. A bone graft procedure will allow for the best likelihood of implant success and improved aesthetics.<br>I have discussed my treatment with my doctor and have been given an opportunity to ask questions, all of which have been fully answered. I understand the nature and risks of recommended treatment, alternate treatment options, and the potential consequences of refusal of care.<br>I, DO NOT wish to proceed with the recommended treatment.
